# Sales Forecast Project for SPICED Academy

This is an application for analyzing and forecasting future product sales from historical sales within the context of e-commerce.

Once you have installed all required packages 
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

```

run the following command from the terminal to open the app in your default web browser:

```bash
streamlit run Home.py

```

Or try the [cloud version](https://automatic-sales-forecast-app.streamlit.app/)
(Please note that the XGBoost model used for forecasting will probably run slower on the (free) cloud server than on your local machine.)


At the moment, two datasets are preloaded: Product families A and B.
